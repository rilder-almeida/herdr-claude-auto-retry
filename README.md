> Wait out Anthropic rate limits and auto-resume Claude Code, the herdr-native way: no tmux, no shell wrapper.

Claude Code stops when it hits an Anthropic rate limit or a transient server error (a throttle, an overload, a 5xx, a dropped connection). This [herdr](https://herdr.dev) plugin waits the limit out and resumes the session for you. You come back to find the work continued. It is a herdr-native rewrite of the unmaintained, tmux-based [`claude-auto-retry`](https://github.com/cheapestinference/claude-auto-retry).

## Install

Requires herdr `>= 0.7.0` and Node `>= 18`.

```bash
herdr plugin install mo-arvan/herdr-claude-auto-retry    # or: herdr plugin link /path/to/checkout
herdr plugin action invoke claude-auto-retry.watch-all   # attach to already-open Claude panes
```

New Claude panes are picked up automatically. Every command runs through `launch.sh`, which finds node on `PATH` or in the usual version-manager dirs (fnm/nvm/mise/asdf/volta). Set `HERDR_NODE` to node's path if it cannot.

## How it works

A herdr event hook starts a small detached monitor for each Claude pane. The monitor acts only when herdr reports the pane stopped, never while it is working, so it cannot fire on a pane that merely displays rate-limit-like text. It reads the live footer to separate a real rate limit or server error from ordinary output. For a rate limit, it waits out the reset time. For a server error, it retries with exponential backoff, up to five minutes. It resumes by sending Escape, the message, and Enter as separate keystrokes, which sidesteps Claude's paste detection and the `/rate-limit-options` menu. It reads recovery off the screen, so it never re-pokes a session that already came back. Coverage self-heals after a herdr restart. A pane that is waiting shows a single `retry engaged` label.

## Commands

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke claude-auto-retry.watch-all   # watch all Claude panes
herdr plugin action invoke claude-auto-retry.arm         # toggle every Claude pane in the focused space
herdr plugin action invoke claude-auto-retry.status      # active monitors + recent activity
herdr plugin action invoke claude-auto-retry.stop        # stop all monitors
herdr plugin action invoke claude-auto-retry.logs        # recent log lines
```

`arm` is a per-space toggle, not a one-way switch: the first call arms every Claude pane in the space you're focused in (`HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID`), the next call disarms them. Unlike `stop` -- which only kills the monitors running right now and lets the automatic hook bring them straight back on the next detection or status change -- a space you disarm with `arm` stays off. The automatic hook and the coverage sweep both skip it until you `arm` that space again (or run `watch-all`, which re-arms everything including previously disarmed spaces). This is how you opt specific spaces out of the "every Claude pane, everywhere" default without disabling the plugin globally.

Every herdr CLI call wraps its output in a JSON envelope, so `status` and `logs` read cleanest from herdr's UI (menu or keybinding). To read monitor activity as plain text from a shell, tail the log file directly (under herdr's plugin state directory):

```bash
tail -f ~/.local/state/herdr/plugins/claude-auto-retry/logs/*.log
```

## Configuration

Configuration is optional; every key has a sensible default. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for all options. If a Claude Code wording change ever stops detection, add the new phrasing to `customPatterns` (usage limits) or `customTransientPatterns` (server errors) in the config file - no code change, and it survives upgrades.

## Notes

- Recovery types the configured message at the prompt. If Claude is in some other interactive state when the limit clears, the message may not resume it. Tune `retryMessage` and `eligibleStates` for your setup.
- Supported on Linux and macOS. herdr's Windows support is beta.
